## Abolfazl - Entrepreneur and Blockchain Developer

I am **Abolfazl**, an innovative individual with a passion for entrepreneurship. From a young age, I embarked on building my own ventures, constantly seeking new ways to enhance people's lives.

With a programming background dating back to **2015**, I initially focused on creating and selling **Telegram bots** and compact websites. In **2019**, I joined René Knipshild as an **Android** and **iOS developer**. Alongside my professional role, I pursued personal projects, developing and publishing apps on **Google Play**. Within a short period, my apps garnered over **250k installations**, prompting me to venture into game development.

This led to the inception of **BotStation**—a game development company that builds on our expertise as app developers to craft captivating games and blockchain applications that resonate with users.

In **2021**, the emergence of blockchain technology, particularly in the realm of **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, captured my interest. Since then, I have contributed to numerous projects as a **blockchain app developer**.

These accomplishments culminated in the establishment of one of **Germany's pioneering Web3 companies**, where we now assist other enterprises in their growth endeavors.
